.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a wrapper for the
.Xr ssh 1
program.
It creates a persistent no-pty
.Xr ssh 1
connection to a fonehome server.
Normal and reverse port forwarding is setup according to the configuration in
.Pa @fonehomeconf@ .

flag.
This step allows the administrator to confirm and accept the server's host key.
