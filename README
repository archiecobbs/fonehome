fonehome - Remote access to machines behind firewalls

fonehome allows remote access to machines behind firewalls using SSH
port forwarding.

The fonehome daemon runs on remote machine(s) behind some firewall that
you either do not control or do not want to reconfigure, but which allows
normal outgoing TCP connections. It uses SSH to connect to a fonehome
server to which you have direct access. This SSH connection includes
reverse-forwarded TCP ports which in turn allow you to connect back to
the remote machine using the included fhssh(1) and fhscp(1) utilities.

Instructions:

    First, on the server:

        1. Install fonehome-server RPM

        2. Edit /etc/fonehome/fonehome-ports.conf

    Then, on each client:

        1. Install fonehome RPM

        2. Edit /etc/fonehome/fonehome.conf

        3. Copy /home/fonehome/.ssh/id_rsa (on server) to
           to /etc/fonehome/fonehome.key (on the client).

        4. Run this command to confirm and accept the server's key:

                $ fonehome -I

        5. Enable and start the fonehome init service:

                $ chkconfig --add fonehome
                $ /etc/init.d/fonehome start

    If you keep /etc/fonehome-ports.conf up-to-date on the server,
    then you may find the following utilities useful:

        fhshow - show all fonehome connections and corresponding client names
        fhssh  - ssh(1) to your clients by name (in /etc/fonehome-ports.conf)
        fhscp  - scp(1) to your clients by name (in /etc/fonehome-ports.conf)
